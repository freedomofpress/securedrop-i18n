# In production, logging is enabled for the journalist interface
# but disabled for the source interface, to avoid leaking information
# about the behavior of sources. In the staging environment, however,
# logging for the source interface is useful for debugging,
# so we enable it here.

# This staging-only template clobbers the production template
# installed by the `app` role. That means the app-staging host
# will always mark the task as changed. It would be cleaner to merge
# the templates and use group_vars to conditionally enable the logging
# for staging, defaulting to no logging for safety.
