Upgrade from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0
===========================

SecureDrop 1.1.0 is the first release to ship with support for using Tails 4
(scheduled to be released on October 22, 2019) on your *Admin Workstation*, your
*Journalist Workstation*, and your *Secure Viewing Station*.

Because the Tails 3 series will stop receiving security updates with the release
of Tails 4, it is important that you update your workstations to Tails 4 soon
after its release on October 22, 2019.

Update the SecureDrop code on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations* first,
then upgrade all workstations (including the *Secure Viewing Station*) to Tails
4 by following the procedure described in this document.

Updating workstations to SecureDrop 1.1.0
-----------------------------------------

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 1.1.0 by clicking "Update Now":

.. _manual_upgrade_to_110:

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the automated update fails, you can perform a manual update by running the
following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 1.1.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 1.1.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '1.1.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

.. _upgrade_to_tails_4:

Upgrading workstations to Tails 4
---------------------------------

.. important::

   Before upgrading your *Admin Workstation* and your *Journalist Workstation*
   to Tails 4, you must first ensure that the version of the SecureDrop code on
   the workstation (which is used for administrative tasks and for configuring
   the Tails desktop) is at 1.1.0 or a later version.

   If unsure, you can always run the ``git status`` command in the
   ``~/Persistent/securedrop`` directory to determine the current version. If
   the output is not  "HEAD detached at 1.1.0" or a later version, you are *not*
   ready to proceed with the upgrade to Tails 4, and you must first update the
   workstation using the procedure described in the previous section.

As a precaution, we recommend backing up your workstations before the upgrade
to Tails 4. See our :doc:`Workstation Backup Guide <../backup_workstations>` for
more information. We also recommend that you keep a USB drive running Tails 3.16
on hand in case you need to revert.

Once you have created the backups, create a *Tails 4 Primary USB* which you will
use to upgrade your workstation. Follow the
`instructions on the Tails website <https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html>`__
to create a fresh Tails drive on a computer running Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Boot the *Tails 4 Primary USB* on the air-gapped computer you use as the *Secure
Viewing Station*, and follow the instructions for `manually upgrading from
another Tails <https://tails.boum.org/upgrade/clone/index.en.html>`__
to upgrade each workstation USB in turn. This procedure preserves the persistent
storage volume of each USB drive you upgrade to Tails 4.

Boot each workstation into Tails 4 to verify that the upgrade was successful. On
the *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations*, set an administrator password on the
Tails welcome screen, and update the SecureDrop environment using the following
commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
 ./securedrop-admin setup
 ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

During the ``./securedrop-admin setup`` step, Tails will prompt you if you want
to install a set of packages every time you start Tails. These packages are only
required for the setup process, so you can safely click **Install Only Once**.

.. important::

   Until you run these commands, the SecureDrop shortcuts on the Tails desktop
   will not work, and the graphical updater will no longer report available
   updates for the SecureDrop code on your workstation.

No additional configuration is required for the *Secure Viewing Station*.

If you experience difficulties with this upgrade, please do not hesitate to
contact us using any of the methods below. If the upgrade failed and you need
to restore from a backup, see our :ref:`guide for restoring workstations <restore_workstations>`.
Make sure you restore to a Tails drive using Tails 3.16 before attempting
another upgrade to Tails 4.

Troubleshooting ``securedrop-admin``
------------------------------------

This release migrates the ``securedrop-admin`` command to Python 3, which is
necessary because the Python 2 series reaches end-of-life on January 1, 2020.
The ``securedrop-admin setup`` step normally should take care of all the
required changes.

If you see error messages when running ``securedrop-admin`` or
``securedrop-admin setup``, we recommend the following:

- Ensure that you are running version 1.1.0 of SecureDrop on your workstation,
  by running the command ``git status`` in your ``~/Persistent/securedrop``
  directory. If the output is not "HEAD detached at 1.1.0", perform a
  :ref:`manual upgrade to SecureDrop 1.1.0 on your workstation <manual_upgrade_to_110>`.

- Check your network connection on your workstation. The
  ``securedrop-admin setup`` command requires a working Tor connection.

- Make sure that you have `set an admin password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/>`__
  on the Tails welcome screen.

If this does not solve the problem, clear out any existing Python environments
on your workstation by following these steps:

- Change into the directory ``~/Persistent/securedrop/admin``.

- Run the following commands from within this directory (make sure to type them
  exactly as shown, as this is a destructive operation):

.. code:: bash

  rm -r .venv
  rm -r .venv3

- Change back into the ``~/Persistent/securedrop`` directory.

- Run ``./securedrop-admin setup``. If the command completes without errors,
  run the ``./securedrop-admin tailsconfig`` command.

If you continue to experience difficulties, please contact us using any of the
methods below.
